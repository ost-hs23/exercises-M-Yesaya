## Open solid waste burning

In Blantyre, Malawi, Solid waste burning has become a necessary waste management strategy to reduce waste volume in areas with limited solid waste collection (Nagpure) Waste burning is a source of particulate matter emissions that cause respiratory infection (Ramadan,pansuk). However, researchers have not studied waste burning at either the city or intra-city scale in Malawi. There is an emerging literature addressing onsite waste disposal methods in Malawian cities, including Lilongwe (Kalonde et al., 2023; Ndala & Ndala, 2022). However, disposal methods in other Malawian cities, including Blantyre, Mzuzu and Zomba are under-studied. Â Studying Open waste burning will generate data that can enable the local authorities to design location-specific interventions that would address the issue.
