1.  Create a 2 row x 2 column table, populate with a column for restaurant + column for cuisine. Then, cross reference it from text.

    For details about restaurants and their favourite dishes, please refer to @tbl-restaurants

    ```{r}
    #| echo: false
    #| label: tbl-restaurants
    #| tbl-cap: "Restaurants and their favourite cuisine."


    library(knitr)
     restaurant_info <- tibble(restaurant = c("Chipotle", "Subway"),
                                cuisine = c("Mexican", "Sandwiches"))
     
     
      restaurant_info %>% 
        knitr::kable(digits = 0)
    ```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-penguins
#| fig-cap: "Waste generation by income category."
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
                     y = bill_depth_mm,
                     color = species,
                     shape = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)", y = "Bill depth (mm)") +
  theme_minimal()
